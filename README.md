## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This being the very first go at a project idea, I have used margins and padding to get the layout as provided in sample design. I am willing to update the code as I learn more about development and better ways to handle specific problems.

Thanks to a Stackoverflow response as mentioned below, I was able to fix the content background size using `display: inline-block`

I had problems coming up with the correct value for margin between qr code and main content. So tried eye balling the figure and for now kept at what I felt to be more or less close to the original design.

### Continued development

To make this design more robust, I will have to get a better grasp on how to align content in a systematic way.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27383014) The solution helped me to fix the layout overflowing issue wiht dynamic screen sizes.
